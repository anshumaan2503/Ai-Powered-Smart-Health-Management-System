# 📍 WHERE TO PASTE YOUR API KEY

## 🎯 Look at Your Terminal Window!

The script `check_api_key.py` is **currently running** in your terminal/PowerShell window.

### You should see this in the terminal:
```
============================================================
GEMINI API KEY CHECKER
============================================================

Current API key in .env file:
  First 15 chars: AIzaSyBuQve...
  Last 10 chars: ...bVS5bx5b2VOdXMNMo
  Total length: 39 characters

============================================================
Do you want to update the API key? (y/n)
> y

Paste your NEW API key:
> ← CURSOR IS WAITING HERE
```

---

## ✅ What to Do:

1. **Click on the terminal/PowerShell window** (it should be at the bottom of VS Code or in a separate window)

2. **Paste your NEW API key** where the cursor is waiting (after the `>` symbol)
   - Right-click and paste, OR
   - Press Ctrl+V, OR  
   - Right-click in the terminal and select "Paste"

3. **Press Enter**

4. The script will automatically update your `.env` file!

## 🖼️ Visual Guide:

Look for a window that looks like this:

```
PS C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Desktop\AI SMART Health MANAGEMENT SYSTEM>
```

The script is waiting for you to paste the new API key **in that terminal window**.

## 🆘 Can't Find the Terminal?

### In VS Code:
- Look at the **bottom panel** of VS Code
- There should be a **TERMINAL** tab
- Click on it if it's not visible
- You should see the script waiting for input

### Separate PowerShell Window:
- Look for a **blue PowerShell window** on your screen
- It might be minimized in your taskbar

---

## Quick Alternative (If Terminal is Confusing):

Cancel the script (close the terminal) and I'll give you a simpler way to update the `.env` file manually.
